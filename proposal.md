# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Super Mario

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game with pyramid blocks where you pass levels.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will be working on python for this project. We will use the mario source code from the last track lesson, add a pyramid of blocks to the generated level, add a flag at the end of the level that either loads a new level or simply displays a victory message to the screen.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Maahin Mirza(me): tur44980@temple.edu, TA - Elmira Talebianaraki
Saumika Pandey: tur78070@temple.edu, TA - Yang Zhao
Kesia John: kesia.john@temple.edu, TA - Elmira Talebianaraki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what we do , we will accomplish learning how this specific game works and the code required to make this project a success.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we can accomplish knowing a clear idea of how the code would look like.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope to gain perfect clarity of the project and divide the code work among us three equally. And furthermore succeed in it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We might need to look more into the mario labs to get ourselves a refresher. We will be going through the requirements given on canvas as this project is one of the many listed under modules.
Maahin Mirza(me): class, main, map, fonts
